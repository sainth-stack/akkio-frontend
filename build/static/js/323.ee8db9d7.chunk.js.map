Unless\r\n            otherwise provided under applicable law, you have the following rights:</p>\r\n        <ul role=\"list\">\r\n            <li><strong>Access and Portability</strong>. You may ask us to provide you with a copy of the personal\r\n                information we maintain about you, including a machine-readable copy of the personal information that\r\n                you have directly provided to us, and request information about its processing.</li>\r\n            <li><strong>Rectification and Deletion</strong>. You may ask us to update and correct inaccuracies in your\r\n                personal information, or to have the information anonymized or deleted, as appropriate.</li>\r\n            <li><strong>Restriction and Objection</strong>. You may ask us to restrict the processing of your personal\r\n                information, or object to such processing.</li>\r\n            <li><strong>Consent Withdrawal</strong>. You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us\r\n                regarding the processing of your personal information, at any time and free of charge. We will apply\r\n                your preferences going forward and this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before you\r\n                withdraw your consent.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>You may exercise your rights by following the instructions under “Privacy Rights” above, or by contacting us\r\n            using the contact details at the end of this Policy. Before fulfilling your request, we may ask you to\r\n            provide reasonable information to verify your identity. Please note that there are exceptions and\r\n            limitations to each of these rights, and that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user\r\n            databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain personal information for backups,\r\n            archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we\r\n            otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. In addition, certain choices may\r\n            make it impossible to provide our Service. For instance, if you ask us to delete all your personal\r\n            information and no exception applies, we will no longer be able to provide the Service since certain\r\n            personal information, such as an email address, are required to provide the Service. We will inform you when\r\n            you will need to permanently delete your account in order to satisfy a request you have made.&nbsp;</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Questions or Complaints&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n        <p>If you are located in the EEA or the UK and have a concern about our processing of personal information, you\r\n            have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, including in your country of residence,\r\n            place of work, or where an incident took place.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong></p>\r\n        <p>We will post any adjustments to the Privacy Policy on this page, and the revised version will be effective\r\n            when it is posted.
