Pages:
- Dashboard with KPI cards and a consumption or stock trend chart
- Materials table with search, filters, and row status (OK, Low, Critical)
- Purchase orders and suppliers views
- Alerts for low stock, delayed POs, and abnormal consumption
- Reports page with summary report (KPIs + breakdown table) and detail table (one row per material)

Workflows: material receipt, reorder suggestion, and PO approval (simple statuses).
