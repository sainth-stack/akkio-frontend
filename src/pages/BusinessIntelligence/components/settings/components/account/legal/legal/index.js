            information.</p>
        <p>• You may request that we disclose what personal information we collect, including the categories of personal
            information, the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected, the business or

        <p>• If we collected and processed your personal information with your consent, where required by law, you can
            withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing
            we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted
            in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
        <p>• Californians also have the right to opt out of the sale of personal information or the sharing of personal

            address, company, and country/state) matches our records before we fulfill the request. You may use an
            authorized agent to submit a consumer rights request on your behalf using the methods above, however, KeyPulse

            regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please
            note that you are transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States for
            storage and processing. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in
            connection with the storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. By
            providing any information, including personal information, on or to the Service, you consent to such

        <p><strong>Legal Basis for Processing</strong></p>
        <p>When we process your personal information, we will only do so when we have a valid “legal basis”, including
            as set forth below:</p>
        <ul role="list">
            <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We have your consent to do so. For example, we may ask for your consent to use
                non-essential cookies.&nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong>Contractual Necessity</strong>. We need to use your personal information to perform our
                responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., processing payments for and providing the Service).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests</strong>. We or a third party have a legitimate interest in processing your
                personal information. For example, we may process your personal information to communicate with you
                about changes to the Service, and to provide, secure, and improve the Service. We only rely on this
                legal basis when our or a third party’s legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights and
                interests.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance with a Legal Obligation.</strong> We have a legal obligation to use your personal
                information, for example to comply with tax and accounting obligations.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>
        <p>You have certain rights and protections regarding the processing of your personal information. Unless
            otherwise provided under applicable law, you have the following rights:</p>
        <ul role="list">
            <li><strong>Access and Portability</strong>. You may ask us to provide you with a copy of the personal
                information we maintain about you, including a machine-readable copy of the personal information that
                you have directly provided to us, and request information about its processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Rectification and Deletion</strong>. You may ask us to update and correct inaccuracies in your
                personal information, or to have the information anonymized or deleted, as appropriate.</li>
            <li><strong>Restriction and Objection</strong>. You may ask us to restrict the processing of your personal
                information, or object to such processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Consent Withdrawal</strong>. You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us
                regarding the processing of your personal information, at any time and free of charge. We will apply
                your preferences going forward and this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before you
                withdraw your consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may exercise your rights by following the instructions under “Privacy Rights” above, or by contacting us
            using the contact details at the end of this Policy. Before fulfilling your request, we may ask you to
            provide reasonable information to verify your identity. Please note that there are exceptions and
            limitations to each of these rights, and that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user
            databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain personal information for backups,
            archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we
            otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. In addition, certain choices may
            make it impossible to provide our Service. For instance, if you ask us to delete all your personal
            information and no exception applies, we will no longer be able to provide the Service since certain
            personal information, such as an email address, are required to provide the Service. We will inform you when
            you will need to permanently delete your account in order to satisfy a request you have made.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Questions or Complaints&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>If you are located in the EEA or the UK and have a concern about our processing of personal information, you
            have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, including in your country of residence,
            place of work, or where an incident took place.</p>
        <p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong></p>
        <p>We will post any adjustments to the Privacy Policy on this page, and the revised version will be effective
            when it is posted. If we materially change the ways in which we use or share personal information previously
            collected from you through the Service, we will notify you through the Service, by email, or other
            communication.</p>
